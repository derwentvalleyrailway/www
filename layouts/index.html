                    <p>The Derwent Valley Railway was established in 1990 to preserve the Derwent Valley railway line. We are a not for profit, volunteer based organisation. Currently, we are working closely with the state government to resume services from New Norfolk to Mt Field National Park.</p>

                    <p>The Derwent Valley railway line, from New Norfolk to Mt Field National Park, links many existing tourism operators in the Derwent Valley. We are committed to the re-establishment of the railway which will enable larger numbers of visitors to travel through the valley to experience these activities.</p>
