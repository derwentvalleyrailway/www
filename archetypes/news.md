# DVR in the Gazette

For the first time since the *Derwent Valley Gazette* was relaunched in early 2019, the Derwent Valley Railway has returned to the publication for a very eye-catching front page spread. The article, written by Melbourne based supporter (and Derwent Valley expatriate) Steve Balmforth, reiterates the wide ranging benefits the railway could bring to the valley and encourages locals to rally behind the project. 

Steve also reminisces on the important role the railway has played in the valley's development. "The train service from New Norfolk was an integral part of community life in the Valley, with regular passenger services to Hobart, plus the small stops along the upper lines through to Maydena" he writes. "The regular log trains to Boyer were common and passenger service from Hobart to Boyer that transported employees to the paper mill. In the 1960s the Hobart Show train excursion was a special, and many would have fond recollections of this train journey."
