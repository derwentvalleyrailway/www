The Derwent Valley Railway currently owns 11 locomotives (4 steam, 4 diesel-electric, 1 diesel-hydraulic and 2 diesel-mechanical), 8 carriages (with a combined capacity of ~300 patrons), and 20 wagons. We also own a variety of infrastructure vehicles including a sleeper replacer and a small tamper.
