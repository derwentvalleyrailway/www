The Y class was based on the then standard EE export design, seen in Australia as the Midland Railway (Western Australia) F class and South Australian 800 class. Eight Y class locomotives were in batches by the Launceston railway workshops between 1961 and 1972, using parts supplied by English Electric. The new locomotivs could operate in multiple with the earlier [X class](http://www.railtasmania.com/loco/loco.php?id=x), although different performance characteristics meant that this was not optimal, although the XA class medications did go some way to improving this. At completion, Y4 was named Rowallan and Y5 Sir Charles Gairdner after the previous and current Tasmanian Governors respectively.

Withdrawn by AN TasRail in 1991 and stored. Acquired by DVR in 1994.
