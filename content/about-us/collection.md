# Our Collection

The Derwent Valley Railway currently owns 11 locomotives (4 steam, 4 diesel-electric, 1 diesel-hydraulic and 2 diesel-mechanical), 9 carriages (with a combined capacity of ~300 patrons), and 11 wagons. We also own a variety of infrastructure vehicles including a sleeper replacer and a Hi-Rail truck.

A more complete listing of our collection will soon be available, in the time being you can find out more by visiting the [Rail Tasmania website](http://www.railtasmania.com/pres/dvstock.php). Please note however that this resource is not controlled by the DVR and maybe incorrect and/or out of date.
