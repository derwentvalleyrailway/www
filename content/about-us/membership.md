# Membership
We always welcome new members to the organisation. Your membership will contribute to the ongoing restoration of locomotives, rolling-stock and related infrastructure.

All operations, restoration and administration is facilitated by volunteers who donate their time and expertise. Perhaps you would be interested in becoming involved in our activities? Contact us for more information.
