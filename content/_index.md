# Who are we?
The Derwent Valley Railway was established in 1990 to preserve the Derwent Valley railway line. We are a not for profit, volunteer based organisation. Currently, we are working closely with the state government to resume services from New Norfolk to Mt Field National Park.

# Our Plan
The Derwent Valley railway line, from New Norfolk to Mt Field National Park, links many existing tourism operators in the Derwent Valley. We are committed to the re-establishment of the railway which will enable larger numbers of visitors to travel through the valley to experience these activities.
